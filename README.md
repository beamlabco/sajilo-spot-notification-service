# FCM + BullMQ

### Requirements

- Valkey (Redis)

This microservice helps you to schedule FCM notifications

## Generating Private Key/ Public Key pair for authentication

```bash
  # Generate a private key
  openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
  # Generating public key from the private key
  openssl rsa -pubout -in private.key -out public.key
```

> Copy the private key to your app and use it to sign JWT tokens, and use the public key to verify the the requests in this service

> **Make sure that you sign tokens with short lifespan (max 5m)**

## Setup

1. Save the service account credentials from firebase in keys folder as `firebase_admin_key.json`
2. Save the public key generated above as `public.key` in keys folder
3. Setup the `.env` by running the following command

```bash
npm run genEnv
# or
node ./src/utils/startUpTest.js gen_env
```

4. After everything is setup run to verify your installation

```bash
npm run doctor
# or
node ./src/utils/startUpTest.js doctor
```

## Registering a new job

Make an API call to the endpoint mentioned below

**Endpoint:** POST `/queue/add`

**Authorization:** Sign a JWT using the private key generated above and send it on `Headers/Authorization`

**Body:**

```json
{
  "FCMToken": "XYZ", # The device's FCM token fetched using firebase
  "title": "Your order is ready", # Title for the notification
  "body": "Blah Blah Blah...", # Body message
  "triggerOn": 178965412, # When you want to send the notification
}
```

## Send a notification

Send an instant notification without using the queue

**Endpoint:** POST `/notification/send`

**Authorization:** Sign a JWT using the private key generated above and send it on `Headers/Authorization`

**Body:**

```json
{
  "FCMToken": "XYZ", # The device's FCM token fetched using firebase
  "title": "Your order is ready", # Title for the notification
  "body": "Blah Blah Blah...", # Body message
```

> In case you want to extend the notification payload you will have to fork it since this setup is for bare-bone notification system

## Using with Docker
1. Install Docker
```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```
2. Change the value in `VALKEY_HOST` to `valkey` (You need to have ran `npm run genEnv` before hand)
3. Change the value in `HOST` to `0.0.0.0`
4. You might have to make the following addition in `/etc/sysctl.conf`, to suppress warnings from `valkey`
```config
vm.overcommit_memory=1
```
5. Add your user to docker group to use docker without sudo
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```
6. Build and start a container
```bash
docker compose up -d --build # detach container and build images before running
```
